# AREA Research Agenda

## Purpose

This repository provides the 8th AREA-directed Research Project team the space in which to create the processes and guidelines for AREA Research Agenda development, validation and publication.

The [AREA Research Agenda 2021 folder](https://github.com/cperey/AREA-Research-Agenda/tree/main/AREA_Research_Agenda_2021), contains the content for the first edition to be compiled and prepared for release.

If you wish to make contributions to the AREA Research Agenda or offer feedback, please create issues.
