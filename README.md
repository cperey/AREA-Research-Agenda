# AREA Research Agenda

## Purpose

This repository is where members of the 8th AREA-directed Research Project team are developing the process and guidelines for AREA Research Agendas and, in the AREA Research Agenda 2021, the content for the first edition. 

If you wish to make contributions to the AREA Research Agenda or offer feedback, please create issues.
