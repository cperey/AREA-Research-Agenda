# High and Mid-Level Terms

In this section, terms used in the literature classification for the FindAR tool, are organized in tables.

High-level terms may include

- Technology other display
- Displays
- People (does this include developers?)
- Business
- Industries

Should we merge all the low-level terms in "data" and "developers" and find other patterns to make more logical or fine grain mid-level terms?

Mid-level terms are
- Artificial intelligence
*Audio
Automotive
Aviation and aerospace
Business - includes everything having to do with measuring business metrics and performance, human resources, process planning, business planning, marketing and sales use cases,
Chemical - includes all materials, compounds, elastic deformation (this might not be a good fit), cosmetics,
Collaboration -
Computer Human Interfaces
Computer Vision
Construction
Consumer products -
Cultural Heritage - includes hospitality, travel, tourism, sports,
