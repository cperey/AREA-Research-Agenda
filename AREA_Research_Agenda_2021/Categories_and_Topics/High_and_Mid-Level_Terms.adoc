## Mid-level Terms 

The explanation of what is included in each mid-level term is documented here.

- Artificial intelligence - this group of terms covers diverse machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts and methods to treat and extract value from data prior to and during AR experienes
- Audio - all terms pertaining to sounds, sound perception and measurements
- Automotive - this group of terms has some concepts that are shared with robotics (terms that could be assigned to either group) and with transportation
- Aviation and aerospace - this group of terms includes some natural sciences (having to do with atmospheric conditions/sciences and meteorology) as well as drones
- Business - includes everything having to do with measuring business metrics and performance (business data processing), human resources (employment and unemployment), process, resource and business planning, financial tracking and planning (retail data, banking, expenses and investments), advertising, marketing and sales (all forms of commerce, customer management and service) use cases, but not on-the-job training.

- Computer Vision - this group or terms includes a broad range of concepts, some of which overlap noticeably with artificial intelligence. Two anomaly noted are the terms "printing press" and "newsprint" which are included because the articles pertain to using printed markers for AR tracking. Many modern principles and practices in computer vision for AR do not have low-level terms in this group.
- Construction - this group includes materials for construction, types of buildings and building trades.

The terms operating systems (computers), ios (operating system) and android (operating system) are in this group and, surprisingly, there are no articles to which these terms have been automatically assigned in the FindAR database. There are also medium and low-level concepts such as object-oriented methods, combinatorial optimization and shift registers.
- Device energy management - there are nine terms that are the basis of a group because the topic is highly relevant for Augmented Reality technology.

It also includes terms pertaining to teaching (e.g., accreditation) and writing reviews of literature or performing research. It is distinct from the mid-level topic "training" with which there is considerable overlap, in order for training to emphasize on-the-job learning of employees.

Terms about face detection and recognition, haptics, handwriting, text and speech recognition are in this group. In addition, there are terms about odors, eyes and many pertaining to light quality and quantity. This group has the terms "personal computers" and "communication."
- Inspection, safety and quality - a large group of terms about the topics in the name. Includes wide range of different types of risks and their detection or reduction. Also includes "monitoring" and "measurement."
- Integration - three terms considered essential to the adoption of enterprise AR: "installation," "integration," and "data integration."
- IoT - compared with the complexity of the topic, a very limited set of terms ranging from "Industry 4.0" to "LED lamps."
