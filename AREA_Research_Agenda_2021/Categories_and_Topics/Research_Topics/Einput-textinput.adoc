# Text Input with AR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs)

# Description
Most applications developed for mixed reality head mounted displays require some level of user interaction, such as text input, gestures, and/or voice input. While voice is the quickest method of interaction, it is prone to error with varying speaking styles, accents, and emotion as well as in noisy industrial environments. Text input is typically conducted through hand/finger gestures or a handheld clicker with a virtual QWERTY keyboard. Research examining user performance reveals that both methods are cumbersome with an average 5-6 WPM. (For comparison, typical typing speeds on mobile devices range from 30-50 WPM.)This performance level is unacceptable for continued and effective use of the HMD application. In addition, users may feel fatigued after holding their arm/hand in compromising positions for extended periods of time.

This research topic involves the study of alternate methods of text input that may yield more acceptable performance and user satisfaction. This may involve the design of the virtual keyboard itself, the intelligence behind the keyboard predictive text functionality, or the user interaction (i.e., tap gesturing vs trace, eye gaze input). User acceptance and satisfaction is critical and a common struggle among developers of alternate keyboard design, even outside of the HMD/AR domain. The QWERTY keyboard, for example, has been shown to result in slower performance than alternative designs but the general public is unwilling to relearn a new method.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
This topic is of interest to AREA members because almost all AR applications used with HMDs require some level of user input. Optimizing this input so that it is easy to use, efficient, and not prone to error will provide for better user experience and acceptance.

# Possible Methodologies
Researchers interested in this topic may examine the efficacy of the virtual keyboard design itself, the method of user interaction (speech, gesture type), or the predictive text algorithms used. A combiation of objective measures (e.g., time (WPM), error rates) as well as subjective measures (e.g., user satisfaction, acceptance, preference among methods, liklihood to use) should be examined.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Medium


# Research Program
This topic examines the overall issue of text input using AR applications with a HMD. It is expected that researchers will exmaine one of the aforementioned methodologies and not all in a single study. The research is best done in controlled environments to determine optimal performance before generalizing to applied settings.
