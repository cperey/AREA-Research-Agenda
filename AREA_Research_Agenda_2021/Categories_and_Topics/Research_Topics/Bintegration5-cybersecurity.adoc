# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment and Reduction

# Description
Sensitive enterprise or customer data could be exposed to threats from hostile actors when in field of view of AR-enabled cameras, and/or when sent to users' AR device in order to support their task performance.  Cybersecurity threat identification and assessment and mitigation measures are critical to integration of AR in mission critical environments and need to be studied. Approaches to reducing risk and increasing resilience of AR display devices can be tested and industry guidelines and best practices published for cybersecurity experts.

# Position on X and Y axes (1-5)

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Enterprises cannot integrate and deploy technologies that introduce risk to their intellectual property or customer data. As long as their data is at risk of exposure, security experts will prevent AR adoption in domains or workplaces where there is uncertainty or risk of exposure. In 2017, the AREA published the first report on the topic of security for wearable AR displays but very little is known or documented about possible impacts of the issues it raised. Studies of enterprise implementations of cybersecurity programs or software in conjunction with AR will increase awareness of issues and reduce risks.

# Possible methodologies
Laboratory or bench studies with cybersecurity hacks into commercial wearable AR displays will highlight vulnerabilities. Tests of commercial or experimental software to manage sensitive data can be conducted in simulated environments.

# Expected time frame when the research would impact AREA members
Near

# Research Program
This topic or theme of research can be combined with assessments of geofencing, biomarkers for user authentication and other methods to reduce risks to enterprise data.
