# Factors Influencing Perceptions of Presence in AR

# Description
Presence is a term used to describe the "feeling of being there" in an environment. It can be cognitive, in that the users' mind is engaged in the content, or it can be perceptual, in that the users' sensory systems perceive the digital assets to be "real." In VR, the user is immersed into a completely virtual world so presence is likely to be experienced if the content is successfully implemented. In AR, presence is represented by a seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds.

In AR environments, users are exposed to digital assets in addition to their physical surroundings. If a user must switch their attention between the two to complete a task, the result can be disruptive and/or fatiguing due to the lack of presence. If the user can complete the task as if the digital assets are part of the physical world, the result is a seamless, productive experience including presence. It also is possible that lower fidelity serves as a distraction to the user which may result in breaks in immersion and a reminder of artificial nature of the virtual world. This could, in turn, impact their sense of presence. A practical example of this issue is with the use of avatars in collaborative environments. How is presence affected by the appearance and customization of the avatars? If a user pays attention to a particular feature or abnormality due to low fidelity rendering, it may impact their ability to perform the task at hand. Another example may be dynamic elements in the virtual world, such as a bouncing ball or a spinning tire. How distinguishable, in appearance and in behavior, the object is from its physical counterpart may influence the level of reported presence.

Factors in the digital portion of an AR experience that influence the perceptions of presence are the focus of this research. This includes the balance of digital information with respect to the real world that is needed in an AR experience. It is also important to study the fidelity of the digital assets as these influence the reported experience of presence. It is not yet clear when and how AR experiences that use realistic 3D models change the level of presence compared with lower fidelity (i.e., cartoon) 3D models.  The research can also examine how much, and of what fidelity, digital assets are necessary in an AR experience to produce a sense of presence. These questions are of interest at both ends of the quantity spectrum - how much is enough, and how much is too much? How high fidelity is required? Too little and the user will not experience presence; too much and the user may become so immersed in the virtual elements that awareness of the physical world may be compromised.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
This topic is of interest to AREA members because it helps to define effective AR experiences from the end user perspective of presence. Any time the user's immersion is broken they must shift their attention which may cause cognitive tunneling. Cognitive tunneling can be associated with decreased awareness of critical elements in either environment, higher perceptions of mental workload, safety issues, and decreased productivity. This research topic is of interest to AR developers and users of AR experiences for both productivity and training purposes. Understanding the level of fidelity necessary to achieve optimal presence will also help developers choose the appropriate effort and resources necessary. Impact of fidelity also may be task dependent. For simple assembly tasks, for example, the level of fidelity may matter less than for collaboration tasks where several avatars work together to solve a problem.

# Possible Methodologies
Presence tends to be a self-report measure assessed by means of a questionnaire. Physiological measures also may be explored to correlate with reported presence, engagement, and satisfaction. These measures can be systematically compared across environments of varying complexity in terms of number of virtual stimuli for a variety of tasks.
