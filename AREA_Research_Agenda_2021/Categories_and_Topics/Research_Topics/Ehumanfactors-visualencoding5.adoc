# Impact of Spatial Vision on Visual Encoding and Memory Anchoring

# Description
The human brain relies heavily on optic nerves and receptors for capturing and processing the world around it. According to a https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-79567-4_8[2012 journal article on the topic], the term "spatial vision encompasses all things related to seeing the space around us. This definition is so broad that it includes everything related to vision; however, it is usually restricted to visual perception of non-moving two-dimensional luminance patterns. With this restriction the terms spatial vision, pattern vision, and pattern perception become interchangeable." Spatial vision contributes to user comprehension and retention of spatially-relevant concepts, and fundamental cognitive functions such as maintaining orientation within a spatial environment.

Performing tasks with AR-assisted platforms is being evaluated for the study of spatial memory and spatial orientation. In addition, with AR experiences, the scope of spatial vision research can be extended to include perception in 3 dimensions and enhanced with stereoscopic displays. Research using AR to assist users in the study of object location, bi-dimensional map-pointing, spatial orientation and self-reported spatial strategies.

This research topic focuses on studying the impact of binocular (vs monocular) displays on sensory input, specifically on the spatial vision of a user, and how different AR display form factors and devices impact encoding of memories in the brain. The scope of the topic includes but isn't limited to "memory anchoring" which enables effective retrieval of spatial information without assistance.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
All AREA members seek to reduce cognitive load, increase performance and memory encoding of workers during the performance of complex tasks. To date, the role of stereoscopic vision in AR experiences in spatial understanding and memory has not been studied. When better understood and impacts quantified, designers of experiences and interfaces will be able to accelerate memory anchoring and spatial awareness. Determining the specific contributions of AR to human memory and cogntivie functions will contribute to calculating return on investment on AR in enteprise, justifying investments and removing enterprise AR adoption barriers.

# Possible Methodologies
The research topic would need for the experts to develop and/or use a combination of existing neuro-analytical tools (tools that measure neurological brain activity) and biometric tools that infer neurological responses by proxy. The former includes EEG, fMRI, and Steady State Topography (SST), all of which directly measure brain activity related to specific brain functions. For instance, SST measures the speed of electrical activity on the surface of the brain, linking changes in certain areas to specific metrics like engagement and memory encoding. The latter includes eye tracking, facial coding, and biometric data like heart rate monitoring. These techniques, however, are not, strictly speaking, neuroscience. This research will analyze data for broader interpretation, offering insights into the use and impacts of AR, compared to measurements made by technology like SST and fMRI.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Near

# Research Program
This research topic can be integrated with fundamental research on brain function. It could also be combined with studies of specific use cases in which the system recalls the users' spatial vision strategies and enhances those selectively. User experience design would also benefit from studies of this and related neuro-analytical tools and topics.
