# Video passthrough vs. see-through optics: the impact of display technology on the peripheral vision

# Description
AR Head Mounted Displays have traditionally been based on various types of  see-through optics to blend simulated and physical realities. Unlike silicon based technologies however, optics don’t follow Moore’s Law. This – comparatively slower – pace of development allowed for the introduction of a new AR display technology. Commonly known as ‘video passthrough’ these devices use computational processing to blend and display both simulated and physical realities.
By design, video pass-through devices block vision completely while FoV ranges from 90 to 120 degrees.  Devices based on see-through optics vary how much - if at all – they block FoV.
As Safety is paramount for the Enterprise, maintaining partial or full peripheral vision is required in many situation.
This research topics includes comparative studies determining the degree minimum of FoV that would be required for video pass-through devices to enable adequate peripheral vision (possibly foveated) comparable to the best-in-class see-through optics.

# Position on X and Y axes (1-5)

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Silicon based technologies are cheaper and faster to develop compared to see-through optics further removing the barriers from adoption of AR in the Enterprise.
