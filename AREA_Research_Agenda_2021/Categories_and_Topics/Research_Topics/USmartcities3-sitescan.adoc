# Rapid QA of Forensics and Public Safety 3D Scanning Outputs

# Description
Accurately capturing accident, crime or crash scenes, and other scenes relevant from a Public Safety standpoint is of utmost importance for law enforcement or other government agencies. This tedious and error-prone work has tremendously benefitted from the adoption of laser scanners made by OEMs like Faro, Leica and others.
Deploying laser scanners to capture crime and other scenes generate a complex point clouds which require extensive post processing before the final models are constructed – a process that takes place offsite after scanning. Therefore potential errors of over or under scanning - which can significantly deteriorate the quality of the model – is difficult to detect on location. This is of particular concern when the use of scanning equipment is not frequent, e.g. a small town police department or large-scale disaster event.
By deploying AR glasses It is possible to track the location of the scanning device and combine it with its effective scanning range at every stage to create a visual representation of the scanning footprint. This could yield an effective “coverage map” visible via smart glasses that would help the operator spot under scanned areas. This topic includes  a detailed examination of scanning footprint detected via smart glasses, in comparison to the 3D scene captured by the actual point cloud.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Laser scanning play plays an important role preserving the physical reality in a digital format, which in turn can inform critical and legal decision. However, any error in the scanning process could significantly deteriorate its utility or render it completely useless. Therefore it is important to ascertain the quality of the scanning job even before the point cloud itself gets processed offsite.
The AREA members need ways to validate that investing in using spatial tracking (as a proxy for point cloud quality) is delivers an appropriate result in eliminating errors.


# Possible Methodologies
This research project will make a statistically significant number of comparisons between  point clouds and their respective scanner location tracking information of the same site. With the purpose to create a regression model that account for measurement errors in the independent variables.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
medium

# Research Program
This research topic can be combined with other projects examining the tradeoffs between fidelity and function of large-scale 3D models.
