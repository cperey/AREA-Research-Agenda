# AR-Assisted Crop Preservation in Food-Insecure Countries

# Description
Food and nutrition security remains a huge challenge across the globe, particularly as the frequency of extreme climate events increases. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) indicates the level of hunger/starvation present in a particular country and/or region due to insufficient crop supply. The Food Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FSSA) "resilience-building thematic mechanism aims to ensure
the complementarity of instruments for high-impact aid. It has an indicative budget of â‚¬525 million over the 2014-2020 period." Additionally, "sustainable food security" remains a priority for the world economy, with the EU Project Horizon 2020 work programme identifying the following immediate needs for further research and innovation:
- Identification of tools and methods, mainly at the farm level for soil remediation and balanced fertilizers application;  +
- Identification of agricultural system approach that can enhance quality of soils for food production; +
- To raise public awareness about soil as a crucial global resource; +
- Enhance EU-China long-term cooperation in land use optimization for global food and environmental security.

AR has fabulous potential here, in that it allows local farmers to investigate their crops, while layering additional information onto the heads-up display, such as water saturation metrics from IoT data, as well as even potentially an AI component that could categorize types of erosion and/or plant disease and provide real-time feedback with regards to required human intervention. This also has great potential in the mining industry, when mine sites are retired, as it allows the company to ensure that the community has the tools that they need to ensure the sustainability of the land post-asset. Additionally, fertilizer corporations, water providers, and other members of an agriculture ecosystem would be able to remote in and provide real time advice for local farmers and other end-clients, alike.

This study would aim to specifically measure the impact of data-informed AR on crop preservation, particularly in food-insecure countries.

# Position on X and Y axes (1-5)

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Food security and crop preservation are important sustainability issues that ultimately contribute to the health of our global economy. AR would provide a vital channel with which to establish a vibrant ecosystem positioned to support and connect rural farmers across the world. Large impact can be made by utilizing existing soil/plant photography databases and AI-driven, AR-facilitated guidance, as well as incorporation of IoT data pertaining to water availability, as many food-insecure nations experience hardship associated with frequent drought. +

Because AR is a unique delivery format that is highly conducive to providing increased accessibility for remote, rural farmers and lowers traditional barriers associated with varying literacy levels, etc., introduction of the technology opens up a myriad of possibilities with regards to establishing vital ecosystems. There is likely to be substantial interest within local governments as well as amongst corporate entities supporting the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. There is also great potential for interest amongst providers within the broader agriculture value chain.

# Possible Methodologies
The proposed research would need to enroll and engage rural farmers in food-insecure areas, preferably those in which there is active remote operating of current crop conditions (e.g. retired mine site, etc.), as well as locate existing photo libraries for local plant and soil conditions (GitHub).

Rural farmers would need to be onboarded into the technology and potential ecosystem partners (e.g. water, fertilizer, etc.) would need to be identified. The principal investigator would develop partnerships with a host corporation and community. Research would include IoT data pre- and post- introduction of AR intervention via A/B trial scenarios, potentially with a few different levels of AR intervention. Then researchers would collect data about post-intervention behaviors and crop status.

Post-study outcomes could be analyzed and recommendations developed for future implementation.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Near

# Research Program
This study could link closely with existing research programs associated with metals and mining, water preservation, education, policy, upskilling, and sustainability.
