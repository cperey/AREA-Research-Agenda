# Systems Integration between PLM Systems and AR

# Description
Significant AR experience development effort and time is dedicated to [BB: what does this mean?: "coordinating AR scene development"] with domain-specific information. While many industries invest in AR scene development, the need is especially high in the manufacturing industry. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software systems [BB: is there a comma missing after "curate"?] curate design, manufacturing, and lifecycle sustainment related to a product system (ideally) throughout its entire lifecycle. [BB: next sentence, are you saying that proprietary systems dominate and there are no standards?] Leveraging such data across PLM systems for industrial AR has mainly become a platform-specific exercise. Commercial PLM software vendors provide industrial AR solutions that leverage their application programming interfaces (APIs) to help establish AR scenes. However, since most large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) operate in complex, global, and heavily distributed supply chains [BB: sentence fragment?]. In other words, in many cases, OEMs subscribe to every major commercial PLM software platform to handle the variety of data representations provided by their suppliers. This is especially important if the [BB: are we really talking about end users? need to edit the sentence to align singular or plural noun] end users aims to truly create a digital twin of a product [BB: production?] system.

This research topic will develop and test a standard data model that permits the vendor-neutral exchange of AR-critical data to produce updatable, sustainable, and maintainable AR scenes. [BB: can we check logic/flow of the next sentence?] Though AR standards provide representations for presenting animations within AR scenes, for example, they do not directly relate to product system animations stored within PLM systems. Rather than relying on a particular PLM platform's data representations, if such a data model was successfully developed, [BB: really end users?] end users would be able to exchange data across PLM software and to platform-agnostic AR engines more readily.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
[BB: NEEDS TO BE REVISED based on edits to first paragraph in description] Product design and manufacturing is the focus of many AREA customer segment members. Resources invested in connecting domain-specific models, such as those stored with PLM systems, to proprietary AR engines and presentation systems increase cost and the time to reaching positive RoI on AR investments in manufacturing. If a standard data model to represent AR-related data in manufacturing for use in PLM were adopted, systems integrators would increase use of AR in their solutions and members would have lower risk and investment to re-use existing or new engineering assets in AR experience.

# Possible Methodologies
[BB: See other topics for a template to follow in writing up this section] Existing standard data representations provide a strong starting point for investigation. Focusing on dealing with sustainment for digital twin models would cover lots of the use cases.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Short-term

# Research Program
OEMs with complex and heavily distributed supply chains should be a center point for the project. Program managers and technical advisors in such organizations understand the issue of cumbersome technical data packages.  This research topic significantly overlaps with https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/AREA_Research_Agenda_2021/Categories_and_Topics/Research_Topics/SInteroperability3-digialmodels.adoc[the Digital Model Interoperability research topic]. [BB: issue with sentence grammar] There are distinct in that this research topic is specific to the manufacturing industry. The other research topic [BB: which other?] relates more generally to 3D asset translation and can be applied to other domains, such as construction.
