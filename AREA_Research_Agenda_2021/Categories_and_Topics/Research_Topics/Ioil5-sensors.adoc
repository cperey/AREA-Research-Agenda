Title: Chemical Sensors for AR displays

Description: Existing AR displays do not have  sensors to detect gases in the user's environment. In Oil and Gas industry as well as chemical industry, there needs to be research into the types and integration of existing chemical sensing technologies with the AR display or wearable computing system. This is a concrete example of a more fundamental research topic: the detection of an AR system user's context beyond what can be done with existing sensors (cameras, microphone, IMU, etc).
