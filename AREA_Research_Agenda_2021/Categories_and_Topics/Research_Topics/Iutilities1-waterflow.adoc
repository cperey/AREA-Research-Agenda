# Visualizing Water Flow and Quality  in Municipal Water Networks

# Description
Most municipal water supply pipe networks require a manual operation of various control units in case of scheduled maintenance or an emergency. Crews operating gate valves to isolate sections of the network greatly benefit from updated information on the flow and quality of the water in these sections
This research topics includes a field test of handheld or wearable devices capable of visualizing water flow and water quality  the data received from the control center.
