# Material Management and/or Supply Chain Flow with Work Orders
Many industries track supply chains and juggle limited supplies of components, ingredients or materials when planning the work orders in a system. Combining live sensor data with AR displays could provide up to date information to users while on the job and assist in distributing human resources according to availability of materials. In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a facility or job site that is nearing the end of materials or has just received a shipment of materials, can bring this information into the AR-assisted user's field of view with updated work orders, reducing delays and optimizing use of resources and distribution or assignment of workers.

This topic explores how to use information that is tracked in Operations Management software about materials and tools and, when there are mission critical updates, to display current information about materials to a user. When receiving a new work order, or during the performance of tasks the user may be warned about shortages and/or assigned to prepare for the task by accepting an receipt of an order at a specific place, moving materials between locations, or another procedure.

When an AR-assisted user is made aware of supply chain and materials, they are prepared to adapt and feel more satisfied. In addition, there is the potential for back-end IIoT systems to track the user's location before sending instructions with respect to material availabilities.

This research topic explores different approaches to visualize levels of materials in an IIoT context to study usability and impacts on worker productivity and satisfaction. It also examines integration of data from connected palettes or packaging and users' devices with operational software to automatically track processes, check in/check out and make recommendations for users and managers.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
AREA members with manufacturing facilities for assembly, or providing repair or maintenance services, or field services where materials must be combined with the worker skills and availabilities need better ways to visualize data. AR connected to parts and supply data provides instantaneous status information to users. By immediately visualizing where materials are to be found, or if limited, the user will lower time wasted waiting for materials, and perform the task or process necessary to move parts or supplies to their optimal positions with respect to tasks.

# Possible Methodologies
An experimental environment using a range of connected tools and procedures will provide the suitable environment for this research. Users of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems will perform tasks under controlled conditions. Motion and time studies, quality inspection and other measurements of performance will be used to quantify impacts. Users will complete surveys about satisfaction and feedback on various visualizations.

# Expected Impact Timeframe

# Research Program
This research can be combined with studies of AR-enabled guidance, 3D user interfaces, live sensor visualization for other use cases, and

# Miscellaneous Notes
Two AREA members with financial support from both industry and government [MxD (in US), the Manufacturing Technology center (in UK) and the AMRC (in UK)] have the required experimental environments and have already begun studying the approaches in this topic.
