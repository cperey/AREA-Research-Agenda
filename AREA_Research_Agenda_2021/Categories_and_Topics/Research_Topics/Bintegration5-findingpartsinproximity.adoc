# AR for Material Management and/or Supply Chain Flow with Work Orders

# Description
Many industries track supply chains and juggle limited supplies of components, ingredients or materials when planning the work orders in a system. Combining data with AR displays could provide up-to-date information to users while on the job and assist in distributing human resources according to availability of materials. In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a facility or job site that is nearing the end of materials or has just received a shipment of materials, can bring this status information into the AR-assisted user's field of view with updated work orders, reducing delays and optimizing use of resources and distribution or assignment of workers.

This topic explores how to better share information about materials, equipment and tools that is tracked in operations management software and, when there are mission critical updates, to display to a user current information about materials. The user may receive a new work order, or during the performance of tasks, be warned about material shortages, or be notified of a new assignment to move materials between locations, or another procedure. In the later use case (find or accept an order, or move materials), the user may receive AR-assisted navigation support.

When an AR-assisted user is made aware of status of materials in the supply chain, they are prepared to adapt and feel more satisfied. In addition, there is the potential for back-end IIoT systems to track the user's location before sending instructions with respect to material availabilities.

This research topic explores different approaches to communicate and to visualize levels of materials in an IIoT context to study usability and impacts on worker productivity and satisfaction. It also examines integration of data from connected pallets or packaging and users' devices with operational software to automatically track processes, check in/check out and make recommendations for users and managers.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
AREA members with manufacturing facilities for assembly, or providing repair or maintenance services, or field services where materials must be combined with a worker's skills and availabilities need better ways to visualize data in situ and, based on AI, predict and plan work accordingly. Traditional ERP solutions for supply chain and work order management do not display or alert users to status updates in their visual field so, while they may provide real-time information, the technician must get information from other sources to act upon the change in status. AR systems connected to data processing for parts and supplies on a work site could provide instantaneous status information and guidance, even navigation, to users. By immediately visualizing where materials are to be found, or if limited, the user will lower time wasted waiting for materials, and perform the task or process necessary to move parts or supplies to their optimal positions with respect to tasks.

# Possible Methodologies
An experimental environment using a range of manufacturing conditions, materials and procedures will provide the suitable environment for this research. Users of any tools or assembly systems located in facilities with limited ability to store local components will perform tasks under controlled conditions. Alerts will be introduced when supplies are nearly exhausted, when new shipments or orders arrive and their locations, and other relevant real time information. Motion and time studies, quality inspection and other measurements of performance will be used to quantify impacts. Users will complete surveys about satisfaction and feedback on various visualizations.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Medium

# Research Program
This research topic can be combined with studies of AR-enabled guidance, 3D user interfaces, live sensor visualization for other use cases in factory and field settings and visualization of connected objects (e.g., tools) and IoT data streams.

# Miscellaneous Notes
Three non-commercial AREA members with financial support from both industry and government [MxD (in US), the Manufacturing Technology Center (The MTC, in UK) and the Advanced Manufacturing Research Center with Boeing (AMRC in UK)] have the required experimental environments and have already begun studying the approaches in this topic.

In December 2014, there was on https://www.plex.com/[the Plex web site] a blog post about the specific use case of a https://www.plex.com/blog/internet-making-things-connected-torque-wrench[connected torque wrench].
