# Safe and Secure Management Systems for Multi-User Wearable AR Displays

# Description
Wearable AR displays are expensive to purchase and, once they are tested and configured for AR experiences in the enterprise, they are be highly valuable, limited resources. One of the issues AR managers encounter when seeking funding to purchase wearable AR displays is that no single user needs to have the display for all their tasks during a shift. In fact, until many more AR experiences are published and accepted, display devices are in use only a fraction of a work day.

In principle, different workplace roles could use the same AR display during different parts of a process or a shift, thereby distributing the fixed cost of the hardware across multiple users and procedures, and ensuring that the system is not idle for significant time.

This research topic focuses on development of solutions to address two issues that currently prevent wearable AR displays from serving as multi-user resources. The first challenge is that unless procedures for cleaning AR displays are tested and proven to the workforce to be effective and safe for them, employees are uncomfortable using a shared personal device. Sensitivity to this issue is even greater since the emergence of Covid-19.

The second issue that presents a barrier is the easy, effective and secure authentication of users who share a display. User authentication, without typing in user names and passwords, is required in order that the user wearing the AR display at any time receive only those work orders and information that match the employee's current work order, level of training and roles on the job site.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Enterprises cannot purchase sufficient AR display hardware to have every employee have their own, personal device for a full shift. AREA members will be looking for ways to distribute display hardware across multiple users. They will need systems to reduce risk of contamination and transmission of skin or respiratory conditions between users. Further, they must provide a way for users to reliably, easily and quickly log into their personal account. Very little is known or documented about possible impacts of the issues around these topics.

# Possible Methodologies
This project will require laboratory or bench studies with different sanitation systems, then microbiological studies to determine effectiveness of different procedures. For the authentication and log in systems, development of biometric identification systems would be valuable. These could be compared with commercial log-in interfaces to manage user identification. Further, after the tests in laboratories, there should be research on the use of these approaches with end users for acceptance.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Near

# Research Program
This topic is closely related to another proposed AREA Research Agenda topic on end user biometric authentication for security purposes [Tauthentication5-biometric]. The topics could be combined with other AR security topics to develop a full research program.
