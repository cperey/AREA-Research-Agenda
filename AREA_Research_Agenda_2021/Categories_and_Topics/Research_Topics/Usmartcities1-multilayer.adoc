# Title
There is a wide range of assets in urban environments :public spaces, buildings, concentrations of demography, utilities, history, movement of people and objects and so on. These assets carry significant value for all those interacting with them but the nature and manifestation of the value depends on the context and the interactor.
The nature of value associated with the same asset depends on the nature of the interaction: occupancy for a realtor, history for a tourist, compliance for the Code Enforcement employee and so on â€“ all built around the same digital twin of the host city.
Following proper authorization, head mounted displays or handheld devices can unlock the value encapsulated in the asset, guiding and enhancing the interactions of the city and its inhabitants.
This research topics includes architecting a multipurpose Digital Twin of a set of assets, associating them with various layers of value and examining modalities of consumption from a Human Factors perspective.
