# Trade-off and Substitution: Stereoscopic Vision for Spatial Audio

# Description
Stereoscopic Vision has long been considered the ultimate in matching physical and simulated realities. But accomplishing the perfect 3D view is still some ways away, particularly at a price point that helps lower the barriers to adoption in the Enterprise.
Due to advancements in DSP and audiology, a new class of devices are emerging: spatially aware audio transducers that not only can help determine the exact position of posture/pose of the wearer but can also alter the simulated sound field accordingly. Moreover, the resource needs of these devices compare favorably to vision transducers: battery life, bandwidth requirements, processor performance, wearer comfort and pricing. 
This research topics includes comparative studies of human performance aided by varying blends spatial technology ranging from “audio-only” to “video-only” and various combinations of both


# Prior Research
To be generated via FindAR

# Key Words
Spatial Audio, effectiveness, spatial vision, 

## FindAR Terms

# Stakeholders
Operations leaders, IT managers, OEM manufacturers, ISVs

# Position on X and Y axes (1-5)

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Spatial vision makes instinctive sense in a number of situations but it is not always as practical, comfortable or affordable as the situation requires. If performance requirements on spatial vision can be lowered if the right spatial audio solution is present it could lower total resourcing needs removing the barriers of enterprise adoption

# Possible Methodologies
Series of experiments potentially scaled up to  time-motion studies using standardized, public and well documented processes typical of industry verticals, use cases and horizontal use case categories.
