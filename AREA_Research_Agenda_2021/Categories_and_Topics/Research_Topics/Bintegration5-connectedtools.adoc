# Visualization of Live Sensor Data from Connected Tools in AR Display

# Description
Combining live sensor data with AR displays enables many use cases. This topic studies how to meet requirements of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) use cases in new and intuitive ways. In the IIoT, machines and tools are enabled with sensors, running software and connected with cables or radios to corporate infrastructure. Data from the tools may be sent to work order management systems, SCADA, asset tracing and management systems (e.g., the torque on a screw needs to be increased or decreased), and frequently there are consoles on which a user receives/sees tool status and diagnostics.

When an AR-assisted user is controlling connected tools to perform a task, they do not need to turn their attention away from the main task to receive tool data. In addition, there is the potential for back-end IIoT systems to contribute to the user's productivity by providing clear indicators of status.

This research topic explores different approaches to visualize live sensor data from tools in an IIoT context to study usability. It also will examine integration of data from connected tools and users' devices with operational software to automatically track processes, quality control and recommendations for users and managers.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
AREA members with manufacturing facilities for assembly, or providing repair or maintenance services, or field services where connected tools are used need better ways to visualize data and to provide instantaneous status information to users. By immediately visualizing feedback about the status of a tool or process, the user will save time and perform the task or process to criteria the first time.

# Possible Methodologies
An experimental environment using a range of connected tools and procedures will provide the suitable environment for this research. Users of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems will perform tasks under controlled conditions. Motion and time studies, quality inspection and other measurements of performance will be used to quantify impacts. Users will complete surveys about satisfaction and feedback on various visualizations.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Medium

# Research Program
This research can be combined with studies of AR-enabled guidance, 3D user interfaces, live sensor visualization for other use cases, and

# Miscellaneous Notes
Two AREA members with financial support from both industry and government [MxD (in US) and the AMRC (in UK)] have the required experimental environments and have already begun studying the approaches in this topic.
