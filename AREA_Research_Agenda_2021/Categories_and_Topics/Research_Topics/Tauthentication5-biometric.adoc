# Biometric identification of Wearable Enterprise AR device users

# Description
ARâ€™s utility in the enterprise is rapidly growing, driving further penetration across use cases and verticals. At the same time the new devices also could be perceived as a heightened security threat, increasing the need for an elevated security posture.

Driven by a human-centric approach, a critical step in ensuring compliance with existing security policies and systems is to balance the rigor needed for an accurate user authentication and ultra-low-friction user input.

Biometric identification methods, ranging from palm-prints, voice-prints, iris scanning to heartbeat detection offer a plethora of opportunities for identification of wearable enterprise AR device users before providing access to enterprise work orders and data.

This research topic compares different modalities of biometric identification and classifies them the based on accuracy, cost and ease-of-use.
