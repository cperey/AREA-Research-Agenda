# Biometric identification of Wearable Enterprise AR device users

# Description
ARâ€™s utility in the enterprise is rapidly growing, driving further penetration across use cases and verticals. At the same time the new devices also could be perceived as a heightened security threat, increasing the need for an elevated security posture.

Driven by a human-centric approach, a critical step in ensuring compliance with existing security policies and systems is to balance the rigor needed for an accurate user authentication and ultra-low-friction user input.

Biometric identification methods, ranging from palm-prints, voice-prints, iris scanning to heartbeat detection offer a plethora of opportunities for identification of wearable enterprise AR device users before providing access to enterprise work orders and data.

This research topic compares different modalities of biometric identification and classifies them the based on accuracy, cost and ease-of-use.

# Prior Research
To be generated via FindAR

# Key Words
Biometric, palmprint, retina scanning, iris scanning, heartbeat detection, skin conductivity

## FindAR Terms
access control, data protection, security systems,  authentication, message authentication, authorization, security of data, access protocols

# Research Agenda Categories
Display Devices, End User, Technology

# Stakeholders
All stakeholder in corporate security organizations but priomarily CISOs, CIOs, IT and Security managers. On the vendor side OEMs, Solutions Providers, System Integrators and Independent Voftware Vendors

# Position on X and Y axes (1-5)

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Securing endpoints in the Enterprise is a critical step in preventing compromised security of Enterprise Systems. Therefore the appearance of a new device class and a new highly personal modality modalities of authentication raise legitimate authentication, Human Factors and Privacy concerns. 

# Possible Methodologies
Rigorous laboratory tests, deployed via multiple cells of different modalities and best practices can establish a baseline. This will be followed by Human Factors and Security research, culminating in field trials.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
medium-term

# Research Program
This can be part of or be leading all biometrics related research initiatives.
