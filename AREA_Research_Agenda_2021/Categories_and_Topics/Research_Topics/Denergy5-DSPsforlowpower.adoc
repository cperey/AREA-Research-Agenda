# Low Power DSPs for Use in AR Display Devices

# Description
Be it for sensing and analyzing the real world around a user, supporting the user's interactions with the digital and physical world or ensuring realistic and dimensional experiences, all aspects of AR displays must be very efficient in their use of computational resources and power. As their adoption in IoT systems increases, technologies for sensing the real world features have been the focus of public and private research programs. Consequently, the techniques to greatly reduce sensor size and power usage is well-known and costs for these components are dropping. Object recognition, tracking, and registration in real time are other technology blocks which have received considerable research attention and, increasingly, the AI systems for computer vision are implemented on DSPs. There remain many other components in AR displays that must be studied and follow the same trend as sensors and Vision-based Simultaneous Mapping and Location.

While enterprise AR display power storage capacities have, in recent years, significantly increased with head-worn computers (e.g., HoloLens2) having greater size and being balanced on the user's head in a more distributed form factor, there remains a great deal of room for improvement in many domains.

NOTE: The above paragraphs could be the introduction for the Display Category research topics.

Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are common components of AR System-on-Chips (SoCs) for AR displays. The DSPs accelerate the classes of computational tasks required for optimal performance of AR systems. They can be configured and optimized to specific parameters, matching the sensors that capture the real world, tasks that they perform and even the use case or user's requirements.

While the data about the user's context is captured, fused and filtered in one DSP, vision processing units (VPU) are analyzing individual and fused data signals to detect key features (e.g., objects) of the real world. At the moment when AR experiences are delivered to users, power is needed for the rendering computations. This power usage must not compete with the power necessary for the optics and/or other systems to produce digital assets visible to the user and/or any other sensory (e.g., auditory) signals.

To reduce total display power usage and reliance on external power sources (to increase the time between charges), fundamental research needs to advance the state of the art in design and production of low power DSPs dedicated to every computationally-intensive component of enterprise AR displays and delivery systems.

This research needs to be published and available to component manufacturers and AR display manufacturers without license or fees in order to accelerate the development of new DSPs and to reduce the cost of high-performance enterprise AR display devices.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
Most of the leading AR display component and system manufacturers are AREA members. While their research in this topic has certainly led to substantial improvements in performance, there has been a lack of peer-reviewed literature published on the topic. There must be greater research investment and publication of results focused on the challenges of power consumption and computational complexity in order to create new business opportunities that can benefit all AR display manufacturers. AREA customer segment members will also benefit from lower cost, lower power consuming systems and integrated AR display devices as a result of advancements in this field.

# Possible Methodologies
Semiconductor and DSP designers can collaborate with other AR ecosystem segments to increase their understanding of the diversity of real world requirements. Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, designers will optimize new DSP architectures for AR-specific functions.
