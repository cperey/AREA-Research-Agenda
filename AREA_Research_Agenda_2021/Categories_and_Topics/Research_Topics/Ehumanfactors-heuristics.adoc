# Development of Heuristics to Assess AR Application Design and Usability

# Description
Usability heuristics are lists of design guidelines that developers and practitioners can use to evaluate the usability of applications in the design and development process. A heuristic evaluation is an activity conducted by a usability expert that involves a checklist of best practices. Applications are judged on their adherence to the checklist items and the results are used to refine the application design so that it better meets the end user needs.

While there are several general usability heuristics available for software interfaces (e.g., Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design, Schneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design), there have been no heuristic checklists developed to assess AR applications specifically. Using a heuristic checklist targeted to AR reveals aspects beyond the general best practices that are unique to AR environments. This includes characteristics such as safety, comfort, user interaction methods, hardware setup and capabilities, and privacy.

This research topic involves the development of a new heuristic checklist for developers and practitioners to use to evaluate the usability of AR specific applciations and accompanying hardware.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
This topic is of interest to AREA members because it helps to define best practices for AR application design. The outcomes of this effort will allow providers of enterprise platforms to more quickly and reliably assess usability and UX, which in turn will facilitate informed iterative design/development, resulting in more satisfying, efficient, and effective solutions. It is important to note that this checklist will complement user testing – it is not a replacement by any means.

# Possible Methodologies
Quiñones, Rusu, & Rusu (2018) outline a formal methodology for developing usability/user experience heuristics. The method has been applied in a number of domains outside of AR and validtaed by experts. This method involves a systematic literature review, examination of the experimental literature, detailed analyses of the characteristcs heuristics should have in the domain, and three levels of validation.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Medium

# Research Program
This topic is academic in nature though the resulting heuristic checklist should be validated with many AREA stakeholders
in a variety of domains and industries to ensure robustness and generalized usefuless among the wide range of AR applications used in enterprise settings.
