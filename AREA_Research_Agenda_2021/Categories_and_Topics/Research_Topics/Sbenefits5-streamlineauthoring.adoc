# Using 3D Standards to Streamline AR Experience Production

# Description
Creating AR experiences is a time-consuming process even for highly-trained developers. One of the greatest hurdles is the specification of real world features to which AR assets are attached/anchored. An alternative to manually defining anchors is to adapt the outputs of real world capture systems used in enterprises. New interfaces and data encodings for 3D capture systems to make those directly accessible in an authoring pipeline will streamline or automate the preparation of AR experiences based in part on 3D capture of enterprise environments.

# Reasons this topic is important for AREA members
This research will provide AREA members insights into how standards used in real world capture may streamline AR authoring pipelines. If AR authoring can be automated either partially or fully this will reduce costs time and errors that are inherent when humans are required to custom engineer AR experiences.

# Possible Methodologies
Requirements for this approach for authoring AR experiences will be compared with existing and new standards and/or extensions of existing standards to automate AR authoring. The gaps and requirements will more easily be provided to appropriate standards development organizations for future work. If and when new interfaces and standards are published, enterprise AR authoring software vendors will be able to use these to streamline the AR authoring pipelines in industry.

# Expected Impact Timeframe
Near

# Research Program
This topic could be combined with other topics to increase efficiencies in AR authoring, management and delivery to reduce time and costs of integration with existing authoring and data management systems and platforms.
