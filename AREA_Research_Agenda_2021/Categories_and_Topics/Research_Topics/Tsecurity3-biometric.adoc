# Title
ARâ€™s utility in the Enterprise is rapidly growing, driving further penetration across use cases and verticals. At the same time this also means a heightened security risk, increasing the need for an elevated security posture.
Driven by a human-centric approach, a critical step in ensuring compliance is balancing the rigor needed for an accurate user authentication and ultra-low-friction input.
Biometric identification methods, ranging from palmprints, voiceprints, iris scanning to heartbeat detection offer a plethora of opportunities for wearable Enterprise AR device users.
This research topics includes comparing different modalities of biometric identification and classifying the based on accuracy and friction.
