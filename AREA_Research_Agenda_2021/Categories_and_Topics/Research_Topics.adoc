# Research Topics

Each research topic is assigned an anchor (enclosed in double brackets). In this document the anchors are in numeric order, but the text "topic #" will be replaced with naming convention (probably having to do with the category of the topic and a value generated using something similar to Bill's quantifying function).

The topic anchor (between double brackets in the list below) will be used to link the title of the topic to a page or a box (in PDF) on or in which additional details compiled in the manner below will appear. The topic titles will be grouped in figures.
