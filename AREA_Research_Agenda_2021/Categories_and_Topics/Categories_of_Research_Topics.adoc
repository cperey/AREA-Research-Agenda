The highest levels are the categories. During January 28 meeting we took action to evaluate if we want to have five or ten categories.

1. End Users
  a. Requirements
  b. Inputs
  c. Acceptance
  d. Collaboration
2. Experience Content
  a. 2D Perception
  b. 3D Models
  c. Human Computer Interactions
  d. Inputs
  e. Publication
  f. Metadata
3. Displays
  a. Optics
  b. Sensors
  c. Energy consumption
  d. Weight and comfort
4. Experience Delivery
  a. Localization
  b. Triggers
  c. Trackables
  d. Computational Complexity
5. Developers
  a. Authoring processes
  b. Frameworks and tools
  c. Graphics
  d.
6. Industries
  a. Adoption
  b. Use Cases <-- this might be it's own category?
  c. Case Studies
7. Policies and Regulations
  a. ...
8. Business
  a. Return on Investment
  b. ...
9. Standards
  a. ..
10. Communications
  a. Networks

  This is a table in which we can organize text

^|*Category Name* ^|*Description*
|<<AnyFeature-section,AnyFeature>> |[[anyfeature-concept]] A generalization of all feature types
|<<CV_DiscreteGridPointCoverage-section,CV_DiscreteGridPointCoverage>> |[[cv_discrete-grid-point-coverage-concept]]A coverage that returns the same feature attribute values for every direct position within any object in its domain.
|<<DirectPosition-section,DirectPosition>> |[[direct-position-concept]]The coordinates for a position within some coordinate reference system.
|<<GM_Object-section,GM_Object>> |[[gm_object-concept]]The root class of the geometric object taxonomy.
|<<GM_MultiCurve-section,GM_MultiCurve>> |[[gm_curve-concept]]An aggregate class containing only instances of GM_OrientableCurve.
|<<GM_MultiPoint-section,GM_MultiPoint>> |[[gm_multipoint-concept]]An aggregate class containing only points.
|<<GM_MultiSurface-section,GM_MultiSurface>> |[[gm_multisurface-concept]]An aggregate class containing only instances of GM_OrientableSurface.
|<<GM_Point-section,GM_Point>> |[[gm_point-concept]]The basic data type for a geometric object consisting of one and only one point.
|<<GM_Solid-section,GM_Solid>> |[[gm_solid-concept]]The basis for 3-dimensional geometry. The extent of a solid is defined by the boundary surfaces.
|<<GM_Surface-section,GM_Surface>> |[[gm_surface-concept]]The basis for 2-dimensional geometry.
|<<GM_Tin-section,GM_Tin>> |[[gm_tin-concept]]A GM_TriangulatedSurface which uses the Delaunay or similar algorithm.
|<<GM_TriangulatedSurface-section,GM_TriangulatedSurface>> [[gm_triangulated-surface-concept]]|A GM_PolyhedralSurface that is composed only of triangles
|<<SC_CRS-section,SC_CRS>> |[[sc_crs-concept]]Coordinate reference system which is usually single but may be compound.
|<<TM_Position-section,TM_Position>> |[[tm_position-concept]]A union class that consists of one of the data types listed as its attributes.
