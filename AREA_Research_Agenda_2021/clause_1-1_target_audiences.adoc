# Target Audiences

The target audiences of the AREA Research Agenda are decision makers that are (or will) conduct and/or fund basic and applied research on topics of value to AR in a range of institutions, and any research organization (in government, academia and private or public sector) which wants to prioritize projects on the basis of enterprise requirements.
