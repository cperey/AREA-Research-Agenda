This report, entitled https://www.standict.eu/sites/default/files/2021-02/McKinsey%20report.pdf[Shaping the Digital Transformation in Europe] (published Sept 2020, prepared by McKinsey & Company), outlines nine actions that set a high bar and that directly address the four objectives for Europeâ€™s digital transformation.

## Grand Challenges
In Mark Billinghursts' March 2021 article in Frontiers for VR, "Grand Challenges for Augmented Reality" https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frvir.2021.578080/full The DOI is https://doi.org/10.3389/frvir.2021.578080

He identifies the following areas as having high need for deeper research:

. Fundamental Display Technology
. Human, Information and Machine Interactions
. Tracking Technologies
. Perception and Neuroscience of AR
. Using AR for Collaboration
. Social and Ethical Aspects of AR Adoption.

Billinghurst concludes that in order to reach its full potential as a transformative technology, the above areas will need to receive far greater resources and attention.

# Outreach/publications
Once research is productive and reliable (reproducible) results need to be made available to a wide range of industry stakeholders who can deliver AR experiences that meet and exceed the requirements of end users.
