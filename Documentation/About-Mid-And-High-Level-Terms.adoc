# About Groups and Categories
To classify machine-generated terms, we establish a set of Groups and Categories.  In doing so, a strict tree hierarchy is formed, wherein Terms feed into Groups that feed into Categories.  The latest hierarchy can be https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/FindAR/Visualizations/treemap-full-taxonomy.html[visualized as a treemap].

## What are Groups?
Groups are buckets of machine-generated terms that broadly describe a research domain. Currently, there exist 61 groups, which were agreed upon by subject matter experts. For example, the Group "Emergency Responders" consists of the following terms: ambulances, disasters, emergency management, emergency services, emergency traffic control, emergency vehicles, fire protection, fires, flames, floods, and police.  Note that these groupings were created through subjective means and should not be held as "ground truth" for applications outside of the AREA Research Agenda.  That being said, we envision that this structured classification of terms could still be helpful for other industrial AR R&D projects.

## What are Categories?
Categories are higher level buckets of the groups.  Currently, there exist 7 categories, which again were agreed upon by subject matter experts.  For example, the Category "Displays" consists of the following groups: wearables, display technology, optics, and device energy management.

The assignment of machine-generated terms to groups and categories can be found https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/FindAR/Data/term-bucketing.csv[in this CSV file].

## Allocation and Assignment Methodology
Categories were assigned using a card sorting technique. A team of professionals knowledgeable within the field of AR were presented with machine-assigned terms or group names and asked to sort these items into groupings based on similarity. The team then examined the percentage of agreement between all the groupings that were created. Any groupings that were not highly agreed upon were discussed until a decision for placement or the creation of a new category was finalized. The card sorts were completed using Optimal Workshop (https://www.optimalworkshop.com/).
