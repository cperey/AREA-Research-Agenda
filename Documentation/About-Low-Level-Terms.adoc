# About Low-Level Terms

## What are Low-Level Terms?
In this work, we define *low-level terms* as controlled keywords from two literature databases, namely Inspec and Compandex.  Note that Inspec and Compandex have different taxonomies to define their controlled keywords.  Hence, the first step to derive these terms is to first alias the terms so that we can compare them.  Simple examples of aliasing include overcoming British and American spelling (e.g., "visualisation" vs. "visualization") and merging singular and plural instances of the same concept (e.g., "sport" vs. "sports").

All alias-making is reported within https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/FindAR/Data/replacements-new.csv[this CSV file].

Bill to write up. When entered into something, terms are automatically (by what? how?) attributed (assigned) to journal and conference articles by (what part? who?).
Is Low-Level terms what they are called by the system that assigned them? If not, we should use their technical (originally assigned) name.

Make it clear that the low-level terms are different from key words (one or two words?) that are attributed by the author at time of submission.

## Usage in FindAR

The FindAR tool provides users an easy way to search on low-level terms.

Low-level terms were grouped into mid-level terms. When a user searches on one low-level term, other terms in the same group are presented. The user can select one or more other low-level terms in the same group to explore (browse) related articles.

## Feedback/Drawbacks
In the process of attributing low-level terms to groups, the research team discovered significant shortcomings:

. Many of the terms are not in common use in the field of computer science (in general) or in the specific computing segments of concern to this project. For example, locks (fasteners), multimedia computing, microcomputers, groupware, and computer mediated communication. One of the terms is "earth." Meanwhile, the term "technology," which lacks all specificity and applies to many aspects of computing, is also one of the low-level terms. "Information technology" is also a low-level term.
. Some terms currently in use by those working in the field of Augmented Reality (and Mixed Reality, more generally) do not exist in the list of terms generated or used by the system. For example, "anchor" (or the plural "anchors"), "trackable" (or the plural "trackables"), "trigger" (or the plural "triggers") are widely used for describing real world conditions in relation to Augmented Reality authoring and delivery systems. Other terms that are widely used in computing that are not found in the low-level list include "point clouds" (which could also have dense point clouds, sparse point clouds), and, even more basic, "file format" (or the plural "file formats"). At the intersection of these, there could be included the names of point cloud file formats (for example, E57).
. For searching for articles pertaining to spatial computing research or concepts, commonly used terms such as "Cartesian coordinates" and "Euler angles" are entirely absent in the low-level list.
. Some terms are in the list, however, lack specificity and richness. For example, drones are an important source of real world data and there are many subtleties which could be detected, however, the term "drones" and "autonomous aerial vehicles" each appear once. Another example is the term "metadata" which, although can be used in many ways in the research literature, appears once.
. Also, terms with which one could search for features of Augmented Reality display technologies are also lacking.
. Finally, there are many terms that are also absent at the time of this research, but would be valuable for FindAR users and the preparation of the AREA Research Agenda. They include terms about geographies (e.g., regional or nation state names), the business aspects of introducing or deploying AR, standardization (for example, the names of standards development organizations like Khronos Group, and NIST) and about the users of Augmented Reality systems.
