# About Machine-Generated Terms

## What are Machine-Generated Terms?
In this work, we define *machine-generated terms* as controlled keywords from two literature databases, namely Inspec and Compandex. The basis of machine-generated terms are "controlled vocabulary" from Engineering Village, a commercial publication querying tool. The controlled vocabulary presented in the Engineering Village tool is defined as a taxonomy of terms based on Inspec and Compandex. These terms are not curated by the authors or venues of the papers, but rather a commonized taxonomy per indexing service.

Note that Inspec and Compandex have different taxonomies to define their controlled keywords.  This in itself triggers significant challenges for commonizing records for query and analysis.

## Commonizing Machine-Generated Terms

We define a list of aliasing rules for machine generated terms.  All aliasing rules are listed in https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/FindAR/Data/replacements-new.csv[this CSV file].  Simple examples of aliasing include overcoming British and American spelling (e.g., "visualisation" vs. "visualization") and merging singular and plural instances of the same concept (e.g., "sport" vs. "sports").

## Removing Machine-Generated Terms

https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/FindAR/Data/replacements-new.csv[The alias ruleset] also includes rules for removing controlled vocabulary that has too much coverage across the database.  Such terms include "augmented reality" and "virtual reality."

## Bucketing Machine-Generated Terms

After the terms are aliased according to https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/FindAR/Data/replacements-new.csv[our set rules], we bucket the machine-generated terms into Groups.

## Dealing with Records Without Machine-Generated Terms

There are two situations when records without machine-generated terms can be present in the database.  (1) We only consider entries from the controlled vocabulary listings from Engineering Village.  In other words, we never seed machine-generated terms beyond the rules defined above.  If Engineering Village provides 0 controlled vocabulary per record, we assign "other" as the sole machine-generated term.  (2) It is also possible that a record only includes one of the deleted terms (e.g., "augmented reality").  In this situation, we also assign "other" as the sole machine-generated term.

The database is a living product.  We expect to update the database with new publication records in the future.  When new records are introduced, it is possible that additional terms are introduced.  Hence, part of the updating process is appending both the https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/FindAR/Data/replacements-new.csv[alias ruleset] and https://github.com/theareaorg/AREA-Research-Agenda/blob/main/FindAR/Data/term-bucketing.csv[bucketing rules].

## Usage in FindAR

The FindAR tool provides users an easy way to search on machine-generated terms.

Machine-generated terms are classified into Groups. When a user searches on one Machine-generated term, other terms in the same group are presented. The user can select one or more other machine-generate terms in the same group to explore (browse) related articles.

## Feedback/Drawbacks
In the process of attributing machine-assigned terms to groups, we identified several limitations:

* Many of the Engineering Village terms are not in common use in the field of computer science (in general) or in the specific computing segments of concern to this project. For example, locks (fasteners), multimedia computing, microcomputers, groupware, and computer mediated communication. One of the terms is "earth." Meanwhile, the term "technology," which lacks all specificity and applies to many aspects of computing, is also one of the low-level terms. "Information technology" is also a low-level term.
* Some terms currently in use by those working in the field of Augmented Reality (and Mixed Reality, more generally) do not exist in the list of terms generated or used by the system. For example, "anchor" (or the plural "anchors"), "trackable" (or the plural "trackables"), "trigger" (or the plural "triggers") are widely used for describing real world conditions in relation to Augmented Reality authoring and delivery systems. Other terms that are widely used in computing that are not found in the low-level list include "point clouds" (which could also have dense point clouds, sparse point clouds), and, even more basic, "file format" (or the plural "file formats"). At the intersection of these, there could be included the names of point cloud file formats (for example, E57).
* For searching for articles pertaining to spatial computing research or concepts, commonly used terms such as "Cartesian coordinates" and "Euler angles" are entirely absent in the low-level list.
* Some terms are in the list, however, lack specificity and richness. For example, drones are an important source of real world data and there are many subtleties which could be detected, however, the term "drones" and "autonomous aerial vehicles" each appear once. Another example is the term "metadata" which, although can be used in many ways in the research literature, appears once.
* Also, terms with which one could search for features of Augmented Reality display technologies are also lacking.
* Finally, there are many terms that are also absent at the time of this research, but would be valuable for FindAR users and the preparation of the AREA Research Agenda. They include terms about geographies (e.g., regional or nation state names), the business aspects of introducing or deploying AR, standardization (for example, the names of standards development organizations like Khronos Group, and NIST) and about the users of Augmented Reality systems.
