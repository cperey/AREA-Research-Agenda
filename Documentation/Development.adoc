# Processes for Developing and Maintaining AREA Research Agendas

1. Generate (and, after the first edition, review and update) categories of research topics with clear definitions/scope
  a. Based on high level concepts generated from literature analyses scatter diagrams
  b. Based on topics submitted by AREA members in response to calls for topics
  c. Based on inputs from leadership and members of AREA committees
  d. Topics identified during discussions among AREA Research Agenda team members

2. Scope of each category will be defined

3. For each topic defined within each category follow these steps
  a. Give topic a title with at least three words (preferably an adjective, noun and a verb) no longer than 25 characters
  b. For each topic, write in 20 words or less the short description
  c. Designate a value between 1 and 5 (where 1 is none and 5 is a lot) to capture prior work about the topic identified in the FindAR tool
  d. Choose one to five key words (preferably from the low-level or mid-level terms)
  e. Assign from a pre-defined set at least one stakeholder group that will benefit from the topic being studied (Target Audiences)
  f. Place the topic on a plot of difficulty-to-address and, on the X axis, potential-for-impact
  g. Choose from a pre-defined set of reasons at least one reason (the "Why") this topic is important for AREA members
  h. Choose from a pre-defined set of methods at least one methodology (the "How") to approach this topic
  i. Choose from a pre-defined set of time frames (in years) the expected time when the research would impact AREA members
  j. Choose one to many other topics which may be closely related and when combined could create a research program
  k. Fill an optional field with any miscellaneous notes or leave empty
  l. Assign an author to the topic

4. When reviewing/maintaining the Research Agenda the following tasks should be performed on each topic:
  a. In FindAR tool search to find new publications on the topic
  b. Generate scatter diagram for the term/topic and compare to prior edition
  c. If there are new publications, assess their fit and put keywords in notes field
  d. Update author field/data

NOTE: Should there be/need to create connections between the Topics and Key Principles and Best Practices?
